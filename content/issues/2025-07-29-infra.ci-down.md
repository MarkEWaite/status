[Final message]
infra.ci is back to business after a migration to another cluster which allowed to find the root cause and fix it.

[Initial message]
The infra.ci.jenkins.io (private) Jenkins controller is down with error related to cloud storage.
We are currently analyzing the issue and fixing it.

All website previews in pull requests, along with deployment of plugins.jenkins.io, docs.jenkins.io and stats.jenkins.io are down.
